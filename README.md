# Finance Empirical Studies
This repository will store my own empirical studies during my learning process in finance, including some replication of famous/interesting papers, some findings, etc.

*June 1, 2022 Update*:      
Empirical study of lead-lag effect in Chinese stock market.

~~*June 16, 2022 Update*:~~           
~~Empirical study of CAPM model in Chinese stock market (A shares).~~         
Updates: Delete this folder, since the ideas in this empirical study need to be revised.

*Nov 8, 2022 Update*:         
Now I want to reproduce projects based on mean variance portfolio (MVP). This folder will contain codes to implement MVP, and maybe some optimization methods, some related literatures, and so on...

*Nov 21, 2022 Update*:      
This project is inspired by the paper [Machine learning in the Chinese stock market](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21003743), in *Journal of Finanical Economics*, by Leippold et al. (2022) And in this project, I will apply some machine learning algorithms to empirical asset pricing in Chinese stock market.
