### Assumptions
- Markets are efficient, and investors have access to all the available information regarding the expected return, variances, and covariances of securities or assets.
- Investors are risk-averse, i.e., they will tend to avoid unnecessary risks. 
- Investors are rational, i.e., the portfolio selection will be based on expectations and risks.
- Investors make their decisions solely based on expected returns and variance.
